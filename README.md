## Short description 
A dashboard that reports the number and type of health workers and healths sites in the Philippines.

#### Motivation
With the insufficiency of health care, health workers, and facilities highlighted by the ongoing pandemic, as well as the discovered trend of health professionals exporting labor leaving a great disparity of healthcare worker-to-patient ratio and availability between urban and rural areas, the rising concern of this scarcity in the healthcare system has motivated us to visualize the locations of the available healthcare workers and facilities to aid both the government and fellow Filipinos in easily locating them as well as being more aware of the issue. 

#### Target Users
- Govermentt Officers

To quickly see the number of medical sites and medical workers in a specific area and analyze their relation to one another to gain more insights

- Filipinos

To see the medical sites around the Philippines and increase awareness on the scarcity of facilities or workers around their area

#### Problem Being Solved
Ratio comparison of the health workers vs health sites available in a region or province, in order to find out if there is enough workers available in a location that also matches the number of people living in that area. Moroever, to know if there are enough available  different health facilities in a location.
